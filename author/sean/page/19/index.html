				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The Annacurra crowd’s heads hung low leaving the county grounds today after a defeat by the narrowest of margins to An Tochar who ran out deserved one point winners in the opening game of the senior championship group stages.</p>
<p>This now puts Annacurra in a very difficult position in their group. St Patricks of Wicklow town beat Donard the Glen on Friday night in the other group game. Effectively, this result means that if Annacurra are to progress to the quarterfinals of this years championship they have to beat both Donard the Glen and St Patricks and probably still hope for the score difference result to go our way.</p>
<p>It was a depressing day to be an Annacurra supporter and the crowd were despondent and disappointed. By extension I can only imagine how disappointed the men that donned their green and gold jerseys and lined out for their parish today can feel. They now have to get over any horrible feelings of despondency they may have in the pits of their stomachs. We all know those feelings as we have experienced them in some stage of life, the ones where some how your stomach feels both empty and filled with rocks simultaneously and a sense of gloom and dejection creeps over you like a depression. There are group of men out there who are that are experiencing those sensations as I type and you read. Men that have fought for and put their bodies on the line for their parish in the past but today their efforts were not up to the task put in front of them.</p>
<p>Its not possible to be sure but I suspect that Annacurra walked into an ambush. An Tochar are towards the bottom of Division 2 while Annacurra ride up at the dizzying height of 5th place in Division 1. Never the less, today was about one thing and one thing only, Championship football! League counts for nothing when it comes to this time of year and today certainly proved that old adage. The men from Roundwood wanted to win more, were more determined to chase the ball and the game and they deserved their victory. They went out with a game plan to beat us and it worked. They defended in depth, playing a two man inside forward line and bringing a corner forward out the field. Whenever Annacurra moved into the An Tochar half they were like a swarm of bee’s protecting their hive from honey stealing interlopers. Every ball played into the Annacurra attack was difficult to make a return from as An Tochar contested for everything frustrated the Annacurra attack. An Tochar then broke forward at pace making particularly good use of cross field balls on occasion to slice open the protection in the Annacurra defence.</p>
<p>This frustration with An Tochars tactics of playing deep and breaking quickly seemed to blunt the rest of the Annacurra game and they were not able to turn the advantage of an extra man to their benefit, even after one of the An Tochars was sent off early in the second half. As with many teams before this deficit in playing numbers seemed to spur them on to extra efforts to make up for the enforced reduction in numbers.</p>
<p>Inside 5 minutes of the game An Tochar were piling on the pressure as they opened out of the traps much quicker than Annacurra did. Early in the match they had a goal chance when Robert Fitzgerald in the Annacurra goal had to react decisively to stop a ball with his legs that had got away from him when dropped onto the edge of the square. Soon after that the Roundwood men opened the scoring when ill-discipline in the Annacurra back line gave them a free they duly converted. This ill-discipline was to be a feature of the Annacurra game as they gave away soft frees in positions advantageous to An Tochar.</p>
<p>All the same An Tochar were not being overly decisive and clinical with the large amount of possession they had and repeatedly missed chances that they could have converted. Yet Annacurra still failed to take advantage of that. An Tochar were not wasteful of their possession on the 8th minute of the first half though when a rasper from their centre forward found the back of the Annacurra net when they broke quickly from midfield to run straight at the heart of the Annacurra defence.</p>
<p>To be fair to the Derry men though they reacted well to the An Tochar goal. Mick O’Brien found himself with a goal chance and was in hard luck not to convert it. Alan Byrne then settled things down with Annacurra’s opening score on the 10th minute and Clive Horan notched over the next two. Clive displayed fantastic reactions for his first when a long range free dropped short and he was fastest to react to scoop up the ball and swing around onto his left to take his point. His second was another particularly good effort. Peter won good ball in midfield and played it down the wing for Mick O’Brien who then drew the An Tochar defence before combining well with Clive to allow him to slot the ball over the bar.</p>
<p>This put the minimum between the teams but An Tochar started to pressure again and were unlucky to not get another goal if Shane McAllister had not performed a wonder tackle while tracking through is own large rectangle to take enough out of the ball and allow Annacurra to clear their lines. That was not the only goal scare that An Tochar created and soon after again they threatened the Annacurra goal and we rode our luck not to concede a three pointer again.</p>
<p>Annacurras next two scores came from Martin O’Brien and Frank Clune respectively. Ian McDonald combined well with Martin for the first of the scores and Frank worked well with Alan and Vincent to earn a great point from play. Ian then turned on the afterburners when he found himself in space in the inside forwards and hurtled towards goal only for the shot to bounce off the ground and go wide of the mark. This was one of many opportunities that the Annacurra men would rue for missing by the end of play but it did end in a 45 that Frank stood in front of and placed over the black spot to send Annacurra in a point up at half time.</p>
<p>It had taken the men in the green and gold a long time to settle into the first half and some lax play at the back punished them but at half time things were looking more positive if they could maintain their composure in the second half and move through the gears. To be fair the Annacurra men won the opening exchanges of the second half when Ian McDonald won a point close to the An Tochar goal and cooly scored his own free. An Tochar reacted to this well though and were in hard luck not to score another goal when the ball floated into the Annacurra square after coming off an upright and both Robert and Shane had to don their superman capes to pull off two fantastic saves one after the other to keep Annacurra in the game.</p>
<p>An Tochar got the next score when they broke into the Annacurra half from midfield and well placed cross field ball found a dearth of Annacurra men and an An Tochar man running into the space to reduce the difference between the two teams to the minimum at 1 &#8211; 3 to 7 points. Annacurra attempted to respond in kind with Martin O’Brien and Patrick Moules in hard luck not to get points only for a slip at the back and some outreached hands from an Annacurra man to gift An Tochar a free close to the Annacurra 21 to allow them to tie up the game on the 42nd minute.</p>
<p>However two minutes of play later and another bout of ill-discipline at the back allowed An Tochar to take the lead by playing another cross field ball to find a man in space from a free for a simple score. A minute later the Roundwood men then doubled the difference to two points after another quick break and good running found a free man for the opposition in the Annacurra half for them to take the point. Alan Byrne responded as only Alan can and rocketed up the field to shrewdly win the Annacurra men another free that Ian converted to reduce the deficit to the minimum again, 8 points to 1 &#8211; 6 to An Tochar’s advantage.</p>
<p>On the 51st minute Frank tied the teams up again with a free and was in hard luck soon after with another free but this time from a very difficult angle on the left hand side of the park. However An Tochar then piled on the pressure and were looking dangerous around the Annacurra goal. Their hard work paid off on the 60th minute when they won a 45 that their goal keeper ran up the field to line up in Stephen Cluxton style. The An Tochar keeper didn’t make great contact with the ball and it flew towards the Annacurra goal on a low trajectory only for an An Tochar man to reach his hand highest amongst a forest of players from both sides to guide the ball over the Annacurra bar and put An Tochar a point to the good.</p>
<p>Annacurra tried to the end, surging back up the field repeatedly in the search of an equaliser. This culminated in the dying stages with a long distance free from Frank that couldn’t make the distance and An Tochar managed to clear their lines to lift the siege and take the glory of the championship win.</p>
<p>Annacurra will be disappointed with their performance, they had ample opportunities to put the game beyond their opposition but in the corollary An Tochar also missed several opportunities to close the game out against us. In the end I can only repeat what I heard from one of the analysts on the Sunday game while watching the Kerry and Cork game in Muster today as I sat down to write this tale of woe. He summed up my feelings about the result for Annacurra today perfectly when he said that for Kerry it was “One of those days the music died”. The music also died for another group of men in green and gold today.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>While Annacurra’s previous Wicklow League Division 1 game against Tinahely was bathed in glorious sunshine, their most recent outing which took place in the beautifully picturesque setting of Billy Byrne Park, Askanagap was bathed in well, water. The recent enjoyable sunshine has departed and left in its place wet overcast weather and that is what faced the players, officials and supporters for both Annacurra and Ballymanus as they forced themselves out of bed for the early 11:30 kick off, got to early mass, (for those of them who aren’t heathens like your correspondent), and got lost on the way up to the Billies home pitch, to watch the two local rivals line out against each other in the senior league this bank holiday Sunday.</p>
<p>The conditions were going to make football difficult. While the Billies pitch was well maintained the surface was still very wet and greasy due to the recent rainfall. This provided difficulties for the players in maintaining their footing and keeping control of the ball. Indeed there were a number of instances of players slipping while moving across the wet surface and many handling errors because of the slippery ball, particularly at the beginning of the match as the opposing sides grappled to get used to the conditions and each other.</p>
<p>Annacurra opened the scoring on the 4th minute when Clive Horan stroked a well worked point over the Billies black spot from open play. Ballymanus responded in kind and leveled the scores with a Mícheál Stapleton point from play. This was to be the last time in the game that Ballymanus were level with Annacurra and within 15 minutes the Annacurra men despite the difficult playing conditions had a 4 point lead.</p>
<p>Ian McDonald re-opened the Annacurra lead on the 9th minute with an assured free from a medium distance and Alan Byrne roared up the field from the kickout to claim the first of his scores from play that were to set the tone for his impressive performance. Just two minutes later he repeated the act and scored his second valuable point from play. Peter Clancy then increased the Annacurra margin to 4 on the 15th minute with a well taken point from play.</p>
<p>This signalled a resurgence from Ballymanus and they reacted with their second point on the 19th minute and their third on the 23rd to make the scores 5 points to Annacurra and 3 to Annacurra. The Billies were starting to assert their dominance on the play with their midfield coming into the game and Mícheál Stapleton who started at centre forward looking particularly threatening. Annacurra in previous games have had a tendency to go out of the match in the crucial few minutes before and after the interval. So things were not looking the best at this stage for the men in the green and gold.</p>
<p>However, cometh the hour, cometh the man as they say, or in this case the men.</p>
<p>With the Wicklow senior footballers unfortunate defeat to Meath last weekend the Annacurra men on the county panel were available for club action again. Alan Byrne and Frank Clune returned to the fold and showed why Harry Murphy and before him Mick O’Dwyer had put their faith in them. In Fact Frank lined out during the junior match against Kiltegan during the week in a display of just how eager he was to get into competitive football.</p>
<p>With the Billies entering the ascendancy and Annacurra’s tendency not to do well just before or after the interval it was important for the leaders on the Annacurra team to front up and Annacurras’ two county men did just that. First was Alan with a wonder goal stuck on the 27th minute which was incredibly important to re-assert Annacura’s control of the match. It was all the more spectacular for that fact that despite slipping on the greasy surface Alan still managed to direct a fantastic shot past the Ballymanus goalkeeper from beyond the 21 yard line and into the bottom left hand corner of the net. Your correspondent has not yet had a chance to speak to Alan about his effort but it is fully expected that Alan will assert his intention to rattle the net all along as he lined up his shot and it was not just a fortuitous accident that he fell on his backside when going for a point and fluked a goal as some disbelievers may have mistakenly thought on the sideline.</p>
<p>This put Annacurra 1 &#8211; 5 to 3 points up with three minutes of the first half left to play. Annacurra then continued to close out the first half in a positive manner by earning a 45 from the Ballymanus men that Frank Clune approached coolly and calmly to display his leadership abilities to duly put the ball over the bar and make the lead at halftime 6 points to the Annacurra good.</p>
<p>Alan lined out in the Annacurra half back line alongside Vincent Flaherty at centre back and Martin O’Brien on the other wing. All three in the half back line did well. Alan was responsible for winning much ball throughout the field, be it breaking ball from kick outs or timely interventions between the Annacurra 45 and 65 yard lines to rob his man of possession. All the way up to interceptions between Ballyamnus’s 21 and 45 after he had sortied into the opposition half to put them under pressure. This along with his vital on field leadership, his scoring tally of 1 &#8211; 2 and the excellent balls he played into the Annacurra forwards in addition to his penetrating runs that wrought havoc in the oppostions defense earned him the AnnacurraGAAClub.com man of the match award, although there were other contenders for this accolade also.</p>
<p>Vincent Flaherty unfortunately had to be substituted on the 45 minute mark because of a hamstring strain he picked up during his supreme efforts as centre back. Hopefully Vincent will be ok for the forthcoming Annacurra fixtures as he has dominated the centre back position of late and added stability and strength to the Annacurra defence. His performance against the Billies was no different, opposing players found it incredibly difficult to break through the Green and Gold wall positioned on the Annacurra 45 yard line that Vincent was in no small part responsible for erecting. This combined with fine ball played into the Annacurra forwards and the timely point he scored in the second half rounded off an outstanding game by the converted Carnew man.</p>
<p>When Vincent had to come off injured Nevan O’Sullivan got the nod over his older brother Jack because of Jacks responsibilities with his forthcoming leaving cert examinations and came on in the left half back positions. Nevan did not disappoint for the 15 minutes or thereabouts of the match he played. While Annacurra were never really threatened during Nevan’s tour on the pitch he still defended admirably when called upon to and his efforts in the Ballymanus half of the field were impressive. His work rate and commitment were heartening to see from such a young player. Martin O’Brien dominated the other half back position for Annacurra and covered the centre half back one when Vincent had to be taken off. Again Martin’s efforts were herculean. His intelligent use of space when playing ball into the forwards was very threatening to the opposition and his defensive duties were never shirked or under par. Martin has come into his own in the last few games this year and should take heart and satisfaction from his efforts of late.</p>
<p>Again Robert Fitzgerald lined out between the posts for Annacurra and had to put his body on the line in the  second half to keep out a long range ball floated at the Annacurra goal which lead to him jumping into the upright in what could have been a nasty knock. Luckily however he was unhurt and had cleared his line. Bob successfully kept a clean sheet and proved very competent under any highball the Billies speculatively floated into the Annacurra square while his kick outs were long distance and accurate, providing the basis for much of Annacurra’s large share of the possession.</p>
<p>In front of Bob stood the indomitable full back trio of Neil Henry, Ciaran Byrne and Liam Moules. Niall Henry took the place of Shane McAllister who was still celebrating his marriage to his new wife Aideen and AnnacurraGAAClub.com would like to take this oppurtunity to pass on our best wishes for the happy couples future together. Congratulations Shane and Aideen!</p>
<p>While Neil may have had to understudy in the corner back position this year he certainly proved his worth and shouted out for a starting position in the future. Liam and Shane had better be on their best performances with Neil looking over their shoulders in the manner he is. Luckily enough Liam Moules was giving his usual best performance, despite having to help Shane and Aideen celebrate their marriage and still suffering for such he managed to put in an excellent performance. Matching Liams excellent performance was also the performance of Ciaran Byrne at full back who once again look strong and assured in front of the Annacurra large rectangle. The fact that little can be written about the three stalwarts in the full back line is really because there was relatively little ball making its way into the Ballymanus inside forwards and that ball that did make it in was effectively dealt with by the three men in the full back line.</p>
<p>Someone else who was suffering from the joyous celebration of Shane and Aideen’s wedding was Mick O’Brien who lined out at half forward. This either had no effect on Mick or he just fought through the lack of sleep and used it as motivation to redouble his efforts. Mick has had a resurgence in the Annacurra half forward line this year upon his return to the squad after being unavailable due to work commitments and a wet Sunday morning in Askanagap was no different as he plucked high balls out of the sodden sky to turn the screw on the Billies when needed. He was ably assisted on the other wing by Shane O&#8217;Keeffe who has also found form on his move to the 45 from the inside forwards. Once again Shane looked committed and busy around the park and his blistering runs and incisive balls into the inside forwards helped to brighten up a day made miserable by the conditions. However the star of the half forward line on Sunday had to be Clive Horan who very narrowly lost out on the AnnacurraGAAClub.com man of the match award. Clive scored two important points, both from play at critical junctures of the game but his biggest contribution was between the 45 yard lines where he covered much ground and won any ball that came near him and some that weren’t that close to him at all. At one stage while surrounded by a forest of Billies players, with the ball on the deck and having been forced to his knees Clive managed to still play the ball excellently with one foot out of the thicket of Ballymanus men and to one of his own.</p>
<p>The redoutable pairing of Peter Clancy and Paul McDonald once again lined out in the middle of park. Peter made a lot of “air” during the match as he leaped into the overcast sky reaching for every ball that approached the middle third of pitch. He was responsible for cleanly winning or breaking to Annacurra’s advantage a lot of ball from both sides kickouts. Meanwhile Paul McDonald as usual put himself about the field making life uncomfortable for any Billy that came near him and putting them under pressure while they were in possession. He also tracked back into the Annacurra half several times to help his comrades in defence and was unlucky to not get on the score sheet with two good efforts that narrowly went wide, including one from his less favoured left boot.</p>
<p>The team was rounded out in the inside forward line by Patrick Moules and Frank Clune in the corners and Ian McDonald at full forward. Despite a large amount of the possession being in Annacurra’s favour during the game there was still somewhat of a lack of scorable ball into the danger men in front of the Billies goal to allow them to show their their potential. Frank racked up three very good scores, one each from play, a free and a very well struck 45 and looked dangerous and sharp when he was on the ball while spraying it around the inside forwards despite his lack of match practice lately due to his county commitments. Ian scored a point from a free and was on the ball several times to lay passes off to his fellow forwards and make threatening runs, while Patrick looked threatening and dangerous when on the ball and making defence splitting off the ball runs.</p>
<p>When we returned for the second half the Annacurra men faded a bit and the Billies opened the scoring on the 32nd minute to make the match 1 -6 to 4 points in Annacurra’s favour. While the Green and Gold had dominated the closing part of the first half they were less dominant in the opening minutes of the second half and may wish to improve their focus in future games to try to control the restart better if possible. Also of concern was the lack of conversion of possession and scoring changes into scores. While running out 7 point eventual winners was obviously a fantastic result for the derry men it could have been more if more of the chances and sorties into the Billies half had been capitalised on. However, to be fair the conditions made scoring difficult and this would have have had a large impact on the conversion attempts so it is not all bad news.</p>
<p>While the Billies may have opened the scoring in the second half and asserted an early dominance after the restart the men from Annacurra didn’t let that phase them and in a 13 minute portion of the second half between the 34th and 47th minutes they took control of the match and put the game beyond the Billies by scoring 4 points without responce to put the match on a sure footing of 1 &#8211; 10 to 4 points with just over 10 minutes left to play. Frank got two of the points, one from play and one free while Vinny and Clive also tacked on points of their own to turn the screw on the Ballymanus men.</p>
<p>The Billies then started a late rally to score two points before the close of play but it was too late for the men from the hills at that stage and the game was sealed in Annacurra’s favour.</p>
<p>This result was a great one for Annacurra as it puts them in 5th place in Division 1. (<a href="http://www.wicklowgaaonline.com/fixturesandresults.php#">Please see here for the division table</a>). Not only does it hopefully secure Annacurra’s tenure in the top flight for next year but it also offers the tantalising opportunity of a semi final place if we can keep up the good form and the results go our way. Lets not get too carried away with ourselves though, there’s still a long road to go with another 6 league games to be played including tough opposition against the likes of Rathnew and Blessington.</p>
<p>In the not too distant future though Annacurra open their championship campaign against An Tochar at 1:30 on Sunday the 10th of June in Aughrim. This is a big match for the lads and we would like to wish them the best of luck and ask all Annacurra supporters to try to turn out to shout the Green and Gold on and show their support.</p>
<p>AnnacurraGAAClub.com would like to wish much lluck to Jack O’Sullivan as he sits his leaving cert this week.</p>
